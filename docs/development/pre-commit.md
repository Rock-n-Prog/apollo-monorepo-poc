# Pre-commit

We use [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky) and [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) to make sure
our code remains clean and readable. To avoid CI crashes for styles, this is pre-commit checked.

More info can be found directly in [`package.json`](../../package.json).
